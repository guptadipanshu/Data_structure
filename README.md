Data_structure
==============

ANY COPYING OR USE OF THE CODE MAY CAUSE ACTION BY YOUR PROFFESORS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT  COPY THE CODE AS IT MAY LAND YOU IN TROUBLE.

These are the programming assignments done by me. These are solely for people to view the coding style I use and understand how data structures work.
The assigments can be easily run once on a linux based platform.
To run them simply navigate to the folder and type make.
Then run the exectable file (EXE look up MAKEFILE) by ./EXE with arguments if neccessary.
See the output.

Common Datastructure which are used in the projects are

 -Stack,Queues,Linked List

 -Binary,B-Tree,AVL Tree,Quadtree,K-D Tree

 -Disjoint Sets, Heaps,HashTables etc.
